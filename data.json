Hinata is a student and an old neighbor to me.<br/><br/>Due to her rapid development, she has become more mature than her peers, and because of that, Hinata quickly becomes the center of false rumors.<br/><br/>But in truth, Hinata was still much more childish than she looked.<br/><br/>“Hey brother, carry me, carry me!”<br/><br/>“No no no. What’s the point of getting old and asking to be carried?”<br/><br/>“I can’t stand it!! Don’t you always carry me? Come on, carry me!”<br/><br/>In the middle stage between adults and children, a fleeting glint exists only at this moment.<br/>For those who didn’t take long to mature, the luminosity was so dim that it was barely noticeable.<br/><br/>“By the way, brother still a virg*n, right?”<br/><br/>“Shut up, why would a child care about such things?”<br/><br/>Then at some point it will flap its wings and fly to new horizons. So at least for now, I want to follow every step of the way while I can.<br/><br/>Today, I will continue to face Tsubakiya Hinata.",

But before one crisis could be resolved, many more had risen. With tempting advances from the mysterious Sudou Mei, and kidnapped by the girl from the Supernatural Investigations Section in search of Rushella, Hisui’s ordinary life has been replaced by its complete opposite, drama–<br/><br/>Romantic comedy and supernatural action in a school setting!",

With her long silver hair, mesmerizing blue eyes, and exceptionally fair skin, she has captured the hearts of countless male students while being highly admired by all others. Even so, due to her seemingly unapproachable persona, everyone remains wary around the near-flawless girl.<br/><br/>One of the few exceptions is Alisa’s benchmate Masachika Kuze, a relatively average boy who spends his days watching anime and playing gacha games. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Masachika is the sole student to receive Alisa’s attention. Unable to be fully honest, Alisa is frequently harsh on Masachika and only expresses her affection in Russian. Unbeknownst to her, however, Masachika actually understands the language yet simply pretends otherwise for his own amus**ent.<br/><br/>As the odd pair continues to exchange witty and playful remarks, their relationship gradually grows more romantic and delightful—and Alisa might finally learn to freely convey her true feelings.",

Rintaro, who has no deep interest in idols, accepts this as a fact and lives his life without any particular involvement. One day, a turning point came to him. Rintaro unintentionally helps Otosaki Rei, who collapses unexpectedly at the nearest station, and discovers that she is too hungry to move due to the rigorous lessons. Rintaro has no choice but to serve her a home-cooked meal and tell her that this is the end of their relationship――. “I’ll pay 300,000 yen a month, and I’ll also pay for food for the two of us. So, please provide me with food every day.” Rintaro is wary of such a tempting offer, but as he gets to know her unclouded heart, the bond between them gradually deepens. As Rintaro is favored by other members of the Millefeuille Stars besides Otosaki, and saves them from their predicament, they become irreplaceable to each other. ――This is the story of a man and a woman who live in different worlds, but who eventually unite.",

I’ll do anything for you,” said Kotosaka Shizune, a university student and a mentally unstable beauty, as she suddenly proposed to Shinsuke Aigaki. Besides being a college student, she also had another identity as a ‘sugar baby’ called ‘Kotone.’ After Shinsuke found out about this, she asked him to become her ‘commuting husband’ as a way of keeping him quiet about her secret. “I thought I was done with mentally unstable girls. That’s what I thought.” Shinsuke had become cautious around women due to troubles with mentally unstable girls in the past. Nevertheless, he reluctantly agreed because of his concern for Shizune, and gradually, he found himself attracted to her dedicated role as his ‘commuting wife’!? A heartwarming and comedic story of cohabitation with a girl with a secret!",
