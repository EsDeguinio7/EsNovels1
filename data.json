      "synopsis": "There’s a legendary Bishoujo Game that has become popular among Japanese gentlemen.<br/><br/>Its name is “ Magical★Explorer” or Magiero for short.<br/><br/>The game’s protagonist has a cheat-like power with12 different beautiful heroines to flirt with, including additional 12 heroines from the DLC, a harem of 24 beauties. I have become that protagonist!………………Not. Instead, I have become the third-wheel character who always laughing like an idiot next to him.<br/><br/>Of course I was in despair at first.<br/><br/>Of course. If I am the protagonist I could have all 24 heroines for myself along with unparalleled cheat power. However, since I am the third-wheel there’s no heroine that would lay their eyes on me.<br/><br/>But now I couldn’t care less about the protagonist and his heroines. Why? Because I discovered magic. While I was using it, I have become interested in it. I want to master it. I want to become the strongest. Thus I have decided.<br/><br/>I would abandon half my role as a protagonist’s friend to train my magic and then I would beat the hell out of that cheat who can solo the Demon King.<br/><br/>………..I was training with that thought in mind, but somehow I keep getting closer to the heroines and furthermore, I don’t know why I keep encounter events like I am some Eroge’s protagonist.",

With her long silver hair, mesmerizing blue eyes, and exceptionally fair skin, she has captured the hearts of countless male students while being highly admired by all others. Even so, due to her seemingly unapproachable persona, everyone remains wary around the near-flawless girl.<br/><br/>One of the few exceptions is Alisa’s benchmate Masachika Kuze, a relatively average boy who spends his days watching anime and playing gacha games. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Masachika is the sole student to receive Alisa’s attention. Unable to be fully honest, Alisa is frequently harsh on Masachika and only expresses her affection in Russian. Unbeknownst to her, however, Masachika actually understands the language yet simply pretends otherwise for his own amus**ent.<br/><br/>As the odd pair continues to exchange witty and playful remarks, their relationship gradually grows more romantic and delightful—and Alisa might finally learn to freely convey her true feelings.",

Society and science now struggle to rebuild, rediscovering scraps of knowledge from powerful ancient artifacts that defy comprehension. These relics of the “Old World” can make the fortunes of those who find them—if ancient security systems and rogue bioweapons don’t kill the relic hunters first. Akira, a young street orphan, sets out to become one such hunter to escape his brutal life in the slums. Untrained, malnourished, and poorly armed, Akira would be lucky to make it back from the ruins alive—until an encounter with Alpha, a mysterious, ghostly woman, changes his fate forever. Alpha needs a hunter, and she’s willing to train Akira to get one. Will her support be enough to help a penniless kid from the slums climb to the top of a crushing and merciless world?",

      "synopsis": "The Galactic Empire – a superpower that claims 70% of the inhabited planets in the known space as its territory. In this vast empire, John Uzoss made his living as a mercenary. He considered himself an “otaku” and a “mob” and lived by the motto of “know your place, don’t overdo it,” trying to lead a peaceful life day by day. As a result, he always went all out to avoid any flags that might lead to events!<br/><br/>However, the protagonist characters around him always seemed to inexplicably self-destruct, one after another…! Despite his best efforts to stay a mob no matter the request.<br/><br/>“I’ll put it bluntly. Would you consider switching to my side?”<br/><br/>“Would you like to join my team as staff?”<br/><br/>His unwavering commitment to being a mob, cultivated through years of experience, along with his swift and precise decision-making skills and unshakable mental fortitude in the face of trivial matters, earned him the nickname “Dust” by some out of awe. But there were those who watched him closely, biding their time…?<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to him, it’s a thrilling space fantasy featuring an unwittingly talented mob mercenary!",

For your arrow to reach the Sizurite.”<br/><br/>Guided by the girl’s words, the boy, who had always been taught that bows are weapons used by cowards in his motherland, sought his own path and gained something he ought to protect.<br/><br/>Two years later, the kingdom of Brune had forged an alliance with Zhcted to start a war against the major power Muozinel. Tigre headed out onto his first battlefield instead of his father who got stricken by illness.<br/><br/>It looked like the battle was proceeding in Brune’s favor, but after suffering a surprise attack, the front line of Brune’s army collapsed. Tigre’s unit had to flee.<br/><br/>The one rescuing Tigre and his men when they found themselves in a predicament was Ludmila, the Vanadis of Olmutz. The two rejoiced over their reunion after two years, but new battles were already waiting for them.<br/><br/>The battle against the forces of darkness, hidden in the shadows since the times of legends, in an era overflowing with wars is now going to start!<br/><br/>This is a spin-off from Madan no Ou to Vanadis. Reading the original series is optional, however.",

A human world different from the one ‘I’ wished to return to. Despite being a demon, with only the power of a baby, ‘I’ am filled with fear.

      "synopsis": "15 years ago the world discovered magic as well as mythical beings (basically beings from various legends) in another dimension. Humankind learned to summon these dangerous mythical beings and use their power to great effect. Seven countries formed contracts with these “mythical beings” and gained their allegiance as a result. The mythical beings will choose their summoners on their 14th birthday and give them a stigma. Schools have been set up to train summoners and magical swordsman (basically bodyguards that give the summoners time to cast their spell) as a result.<br/><br/>15 years later after the finding of magic Kazuki Hayashizaki is chosen as a summoner and given a stigma to indicate that. This is surprising since males aren’t chosen as summoners due to their low amount of mana compared to females. As the first male to be a summoner Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone.<br/><br/>To complicate matters his sister (who’s a magical swordsman) is against him going into summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman have a cat mouse thing going on where summoners look down on magical swordsman as inferior so his sister naturally is against him going there. She’ll stop him even if it means going to war.<br/><br/>Kazuki however is determined to thrive in summoner school and has already determined to give it his all. Even if he’s the lowest ranked student (ranked E) and his fellow students intend to demean him he’ll prove himself as the strongest summoner.",

Rintaro, who has no deep interest in idols, accepts this as a fact and lives his life without any particular involvement. One day, a turning point came to him. Rintaro unintentionally helps Otosaki Rei, who collapses unexpectedly at the nearest station, and discovers that she is too hungry to move due to the rigorous lessons. Rintaro has no choice but to serve her a home-cooked meal and tell her that this is the end of their relationship――. “I’ll pay 300,000 yen a month, and I’ll also pay for food for the two of us. So, please provide me with food every day.” Rintaro is wary of such a tempting offer, but as he gets to know her unclouded heart, the bond between them gradually deepens. As Rintaro is favored by other members of the Millefeuille Stars besides Otosaki, and saves them from their predicament, they become irreplaceable to each other. ――This is the story of a man and a woman who live in different worlds, but who eventually unite.",

      "synopsis": "In a land of swords and magic, there was a creature—an evil god—with extraordinary power. People feared its existence, but at the same time were captivated by its power. They wanted that power. Their dangerous wish would eventually lead them to break the evil god’s horn and create “Shin Kaku Gi Kou,” huge magical weapons infused with the horn.<br/><br/>One of these weapons alone has enough strength to overpower an entire country and its army, and there are 10 of these across the vast continent. However, one day a severely injured Moebius, the strongest Shin Kaku Gi Kou user, entrusted his “power” to a young boy named Miyabi who happened to be present.<br/><br/>There is an 11th user out there that no one knows about. You must protect everyone before the out-of-control monster destroys the entire continent, he was told.",

      "synopsis": "For me, it was just a normal thing. But they trusted me deeply.<br/><br/>After being reincarnated, I found myself in a school life surrounded by nobles. I was born into a wealthy and arrogant noble family, but I tried to behave as a modern person, treating everyone kindly regardless of their social status. I didn’t let the class difference bother me.<br/><br/>Amidst this school life, Luna, a noble young lady, took a liking to me. She was usually quiet and didn’t open up to anyone, but she was different with me. She would have meals with me and even go on dates, albeit shyly.<br/><br/>“I have no intention of spending time with anyone other than you.”<br/><br/>In this school life, I also became close to other noble girls and maids. They were all graceful, refined, and would occasionally act sweetly towards me.<br/><br/>As my relationships with these lovely ladies deepened, a heartwarming school romantic comedy began to unfold!",

      "synopsis": "In the abandoned B3 underground plaza of a large train station, Sugiyado Souha, a 17-year-old boy with a scar on his face, was facing two fighting groups of kunoichis.<br/><br/>On one side was Kuhou Ouka. She was a girl of 13 or 14 with her long chestnut hair worn in twintails. She wore a special fiber outfit that fit snugly to her young bodylines and she held a hunting gun with two stacked barrels, a bayonet, and a multipurpose sight that resembled binoculars.<br/><br/>On the other side was Shirazaya Guren and Suiren. Those identical girls of 16 or 17 had semi-long blonde hair. They could only be distinguished by the white or red extensions attached next to one of their ears and by the flower decorations in their hair. The two slender girls each held a special-steel ninja sword and a kusarigama.<br/><br/>“Stop this! Keep this up and you’ll die!!”<br/><br/>Ugh, thought Sugiyado Souha while looking up toward the sky.<br/><br/>He lamented to himself while confirming the sensation of the sealed poison gas container in his hands.<br/><br/>How did I find myself in this mess?",

However, that world was suddenly “overwritten” in front of a boy named Kai. In the rewritten world, Kai saw the scene where humans lost the five tribal wars because of the absence of hero Sid. Here dragons and demons dominate the ground, and Kai is a forgotten existence from all human beings. However, after encountering the mysterious girl Rinne, Kai decides to break this rewritten destiny. In a world without heroes, he inherits the hero’s sword and martial art to challenge the mighty enemy races who reign supreme.",

I’ll do anything for you,” said Kotosaka Shizune, a university student and a mentally unstable beauty, as she suddenly proposed to Shinsuke Aigaki. Besides being a college student, she also had another identity as a ‘sugar baby’ called ‘Kotone.’ After Shinsuke found out about this, she asked him to become her ‘commuting husband’ as a way of keeping him quiet about her secret. “I thought I was done with mentally unstable girls. That’s what I thought.” Shinsuke had become cautious around women due to troubles with mentally unstable girls in the past. Nevertheless, he reluctantly agreed because of his concern for Shizune, and gradually, he found himself attracted to her dedicated role as his ‘commuting wife’!? A heartwarming and comedic story of cohabitation with a girl with a secret!",
