After being woken up by his cute little sister, Itsuka Shidou believed that it would be the start of another normal day.

In a corner of the street which had now become a crater, the girl was there.<br/><br/>“?You, have you come to kill me too?”<br/><br/>She is the disaster that will destroy humanity, a monster of unknown origin, and a being rejected by the world. There are only two ways to stop this girl: annihilation, and conversation. His little sister Kotori, wrapped in a military uniform, thus said to Shidou: “Since it’s like this, just go date her, and make the spirit fall for you!” “Wh.. whaaaaaaaat!?” Enter a new age of boy meets girl!!",

He’d treat my injuries with herbs, help me sleep, and give me water and biscuits when I couldn’t move.<br/><br/>For the first time, I felt warmth, and I made a decision. “If it’s you, big brother, it’s okay even if you kill me.”<br/><br/>This unexpected encounter between two lonely souls, not part of the game’s original plan, would change the game entirely! A story of a pure-hearted princess and a cunning assassin, with a significant age gap and one-sided love.",

But his childhood friend shakes her head, saying that she prefers Ryunosuke.<br/><br/>When he asked her about it, she said that the person she likes has similar characteristics to him.<br/><br/>(Isn’t that me?). But he was too embarrassed to ask her, fearing that he might be wrong.<br/><br/>“He’s good-looking, from my point of view.”<br/><br/>(Oh, no.)<br/><br/>“He doesn’t have many friends. He’s also a bit of a nerd.”<br/><br/>(You mean me?)<br/><br/>“But he’s refreshing.”<br/><br/>(That’s not me.)<br/><br/>“He’s a guy I’ve known for a long time who lives in my neighborhood.”<br/><br/>(That’s me, right?)<br/><br/>Without knowing for sure, Ryunosuke gives Shiori some advice even though he doesn’t know what to do with her.<br/><br/>But what he doesn’t realize is that his advice is being put into practice.<br/><br/>As he counsels her, he becomes aware of her as a girl, and before he knows it, he begins to like her without even realizing it.",

With her long silver hair, mesmerizing blue eyes, and exceptionally fair skin, she has captured the hearts of countless male students while being highly admired by all others. Even so, due to her seemingly unapproachable persona, everyone remains wary around the near-flawless girl.<br/><br/>One of the few exceptions is Alisa’s benchmate Masachika Kuze, a relatively average boy who spends his days watching anime and playing gacha games. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Masachika is the sole student to receive Alisa’s attention. Unable to be fully honest, Alisa is frequently harsh on Masachika and only expresses her affection in Russian. Unbeknownst to her, however, Masachika actually understands the language yet simply pretends otherwise for his own amus**ent.<br/><br/>As the odd pair continues to exchange witty and playful remarks, their relationship gradually grows more romantic and delightful—and Alisa might finally learn to freely convey her true feelings.",

Rintaro, who has no deep interest in idols, accepts this as a fact and lives his life without any particular involvement. One day, a turning point came to him. Rintaro unintentionally helps Otosaki Rei, who collapses unexpectedly at the nearest station, and discovers that she is too hungry to move due to the rigorous lessons. Rintaro has no choice but to serve her a home-cooked meal and tell her that this is the end of their relationship――. “I’ll pay 300,000 yen a month, and I’ll also pay for food for the two of us. So, please provide me with food every day.” Rintaro is wary of such a tempting offer, but as he gets to know her unclouded heart, the bond between them gradually deepens. As Rintaro is favored by other members of the Millefeuille Stars besides Otosaki, and saves them from their predicament, they become irreplaceable to each other. ――This is the story of a man and a woman who live in different worlds, but who eventually unite.",

I’ll do anything for you,” said Kotosaka Shizune, a university student and a mentally unstable beauty, as she suddenly proposed to Shinsuke Aigaki. Besides being a college student, she also had another identity as a ‘sugar baby’ called ‘Kotone.’ After Shinsuke found out about this, she asked him to become her ‘commuting husband’ as a way of keeping him quiet about her secret. “I thought I was done with mentally unstable girls. That’s what I thought.” Shinsuke had become cautious around women due to troubles with mentally unstable girls in the past. Nevertheless, he reluctantly agreed because of his concern for Shizune, and gradually, he found himself attracted to her dedicated role as his ‘commuting wife’!? A heartwarming and comedic story of cohabitation with a girl with a secret!",
