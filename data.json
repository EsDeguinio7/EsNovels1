I’ll do anything for you,” said Kotosaka Shizune, a university student and a mentally unstable beauty, as she suddenly proposed to Shinsuke Aigaki. Besides being a college student, she also had another identity as a ‘sugar baby’ called ‘Kotone.’ After Shinsuke found out about this, she asked him to become her ‘commuting husband’ as a way of keeping him quiet about her secret. “I thought I was done with mentally unstable girls. That’s what I thought.” Shinsuke had become cautious around women due to troubles with mentally unstable girls in the past. Nevertheless, he reluctantly agreed because of his concern for Shizune, and gradually, he found himself attracted to her dedicated role as his ‘commuting wife’!?
