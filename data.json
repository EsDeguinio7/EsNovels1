Meeting in spring, checking out the summer fireworks, the cultural festival in fall, running away during the cold winter…<br/><br/>The more memories we built together, the easier I realized—that she was still just a normal girl. So could I, the strongest shadow user and hunter of humanity’s evil, possibly save her before it’s too late?",
